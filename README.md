### Hi there üëã –í—Å–µ–º –ø—Ä–∏–≤–µ—Ç!

As a Salesforce Developer at Eli Lilly and Company, a top 20 global pharmaceutical company, I develop, support, and automate business processes using Apex, Visualforce, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and LWC.

I enjoy working with business partners to identify and clarify requirements, following Agile and DevOps methodologies to deliver innovative solutions that meet and exceed expectations. For example, I developed an application for Travel Expenses Reporting in Russia and Kazakhstan, which streamlined and simplified the expense reporting process using approvals workflow and PDF-archiving. I also created an efficient Salesforce tool that monitors and alerts persons who responsible for promotional events about missing or incorrect records using Apex Batch and Scheduler. 

I collaborate with business partners across Russia, Kazakhstan, and Israel, and I speak both Russian and English.
